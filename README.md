# ChromaSkin

ChromaSkin lets you mix and match your favorite syntax highlighting with custom editor chrome colors. Keep the code highlighting you love while personalizing VS Code's overall look and feel.

## ✨ Features

ChromaSkin separates VS Code's chrome (UI elements like activity bar, sidebar, panels) from syntax highlighting, giving you unprecedented customization:

- 🎨 Use any syntax highlighting theme you love
- 🎯 Customize only the editor chrome/UI colors
- 🖼️ Keep your preferred token colors untouched

Here's how it looks in action:
